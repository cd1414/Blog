Before you can create your site, you must have a repository for your site on GitHub. If you're not creating your site in an existing repository, see "Creating a repository for your site."

On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.

Decide which publishing source you want to use. For more information, see "About GitHub Pages."

If your chosen publishing source already exists, navigate to the publishing source. If your chosen publishing source doesn't exist, create the publishing source.

In the root of the publishing source, create a new file called index.md that contains the content you want to display on the main page of your site.

Configure your publishing source. For more information, see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site."

Under your repository name, click  Settings.
